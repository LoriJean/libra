# The worker versions the JSON messages that it comprehends. This version
# is used for the DISCOVER message that can be sent by the API server. E.g.,
#
#      { 'hpcs_action': 'DISCOVER' }
#
# And an example response from the worker:
#
#      {
#        'hpcs_action': 'DISCOVER',
#        'version': '1.0',
#        'hpcs_response': 'PASS'
#      }
#
# The version number is set in the method:
#
#      libra.worker.controller._action_discover()
#
# Version format is: <major>.<minor>
#
# A change to the <minor> value means that a change has been made, but
# we are still backwards compatible. A change to the <major> value means
# a significant change was made and we are no longer compatible with older
# versions.
