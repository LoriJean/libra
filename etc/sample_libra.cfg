# A sample configuration file read by the Libra utilities that use the
# Options class from the libra/common/options.py module.
#
# Options are expressed in one of two forms:
#    key = value
#    key : value
#
# Boolean options should be given either a 'true' or 'false' value.
# Some options can contain multiple values (see 'server' option in the
# [worker] section).
#
# Options given on the command line will override any options set in
# the configuration file.
