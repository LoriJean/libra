Description
-----------

A Python-based Gearman worker that handles work for the job queue named
'lbaas-<IP>'. It receives JSON data describing a load balancer, and
returns this same JSON object, but with status fields added to describe
the state of the LB.


Running Tests
-------------

Tox is the best way to run the tests. Tox, if unavailable, can be installed
via the Python pip command:

   $ pip install tox

Once it is installed, run the tests:

   $ tox


Installing the Worker
---------------------

    $ python setup.py install


Running the Worker
------------------

The worker can run in either daemon or non-daemon mode. Daemon mode requires
escalated privileges so that it can behave like a proper daemon. Non-daemon
mode (-d option) is useful for testing.

Basic commands:

    # Getting help
    $ libra_worker -h

    # Start up as a daemon
    $ sudo libra_worker

    # Start up with debugging output in non-daemon mode
    $ libra_worker --debug -d

You can verify that the worker is running by using the sample Gearman
client in the bin/ directory:

    $ bin/client.py
