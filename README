Description
-----------

A Python-based Gearman worker that handles work for the job queue named
'lbaas-<IP>'. It receives JSON data describing a load balancer, and
returns this same JSON object, but with status fields added to describe
the state of the LB.


Running Tests
-------------

Tox is the best way to run the tests. Tox, if unavailable, can be installed
via the Python pip command:

   $ pip install tox

Once it is installed, run the tests:

   $ tox


Installing the Worker
---------------------

    $ python setup.py install


Running the Worker
------------------

Basic commands:

    # Getting help
    $ lbaas_worker -h

    # Start up with debugging output
    $ lbaas_worker --debug

You can verify that the worker is running by using the sample Gearman
client in the bin/ directory:

    $ bin/client.py
